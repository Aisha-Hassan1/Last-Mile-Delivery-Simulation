# Last Mile Delivery Simulation

This project simulates last-mile delivery using the Google Maps API to provide real-time routes between vehicles, stores, and homes for order delivery. Users can input the number of stores, vehicles, and their capacities, as well as the country and city where the stores are located. The application then displays a map where users can input the number of orders to see markers on the map. Hovering over a marker reveals its details. Clicking a store marker draws a route from the store to a vehicle for order delivery, and clicking again removes the route. The same functionality applies to vehicles delivering orders to homes.

## Features
- **Interactive Map Interface:** Provides an interactive map for easy visualization and interaction.
- **Click-Based Selection:** Allows users to click on the map to see and manage routes.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aisha-Hassan1/Last-Mile-Delivery-Simulation.git
    ```
2. Obtain an API key from the Google Maps Platform: [Get an API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key).
3. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key in the project files.
4. Run the application.
